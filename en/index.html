    <p>1. Learn a Programming Language It doesn’t matter what language you pick, but it is important to learn at least one. You will be able to use that language to write automation scripts.
article Guide to Picking a Language for DevOps The guide recommends Python or Go for programming languages and Bash or PowerShell Core for shell scripting in DevOps. Python is versatile, widely used for automation and tools, while Go is crucial for container technologies like Kubernetes and Docker. Bash is ideal for Linux environments, and PowerShell Core is cross-platform, suitable for Windows and Linux. For more details, check the full guide here.

    <p>★Problems with Traditional Textbooks Core Issues
Goal of Traditional Textbooks: To quickly teach practical and polite Japanese, but they overlook the true logic of the language. Main Problems: Teaching Japanese from an English perspective, making it difficult to truly understand Japanese expressions. Attempting to translate English phrases rather than teaching the Japanese grammatical system. Ignoring kanji study, leaving learners unable to read and comprehend Japanese texts in practical situations. Introducing honorifics too early without a solid foundation, causing confusion. Emphasizing complete sentence expressions (e.g., &#34;Hi, my name is Smith&#34;), but in Japanese, much information is omitted through context. Solution: Learn Japanese with Japanese Logic

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Introduction to Learning Japanese: Efficient Methods 1. Find a Textbook (Recommended: “Minna no Nihongo” (みんなの日本語)) Reasons for Recommendation: Textbooks written by Japanese authors contain errors commonly made by Japanese people, which won’t affect your Japanese proficiency in the eyes of native speakers. The key is to choose a textbook that suits you and that you can learn from, rather than one with perfect content. Textbook Structure: Main Book (entirely in Japanese) Teacher’s Guide (includes vocabulary lists, Chinese explanations, etc.) 2. Prepare a Repeater or Repeater Software Functional Requirements: Able to set repeat positions. Preferably has a function for decomposing and memorizing recordings. 3. Pre-class Preparation 1. Do Not Read the Text First; Start with the Vocabulary and Grammar Explanations If using “Minna no Nihongo,” only refer to the Teacher’s Guide and avoid the main book content. Also, skip the text translation parts in the Teacher’s Guide initially. 2. Memorize Vocabulary and Grammar First Memorize Vocabulary by Listening to Recordings Initial Memorization

    <p>Introduction to Learning Japanese: Core Concepts First Core: Everything Revolves Around Sentences! Sentences are Everything! Sentences are Wealth! Sentences are simple, clear, easy to master, and can be immediately used for communication!
Passionate Achievements If you can speak ten sentences fluently every day, you can accumulate over 3,600 sentences in a year. By extrapolating, you can master nearly 10,000 practical sentences, reaching a level of free communication! After one year of learning Japanese, a student’s ability will far surpass that of most university Japanese majors, who may not even be able to speak ten consecutive sentences in Japanese. Lifelong Hobby Collect good sentences and practice them repeatedly until you can say them fluently. This habit has inspired many people under my influence to start loving Japanese and embark on the path to success! Take Action Now (Let’s spend 10 minutes learning the ten most commonly used Japanese sentences) どちらにお住まいですか。 (Where do you live?) どうやってこちらへみえましたか。 (How did you get here?) お体はいかがですか。 (How is your health?) 家族はお見えですか。 (Do you live alone?) お仕事はどちらですか。 (Where do you work?) 今度の日曜日はお暇ですか。 (Are you free this Sunday?) どちらにお勤めですか。 (Where do you work?) わからないことはありますか。 (Is there anything you don’t understand?) お困りのことはありませんか。 (Is there anything troubling you?) 仕事が終わったら、お会いできますか。 (Can we meet after work?)
