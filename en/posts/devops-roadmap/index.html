Networking \u0026 Protocols Networking protocols are standardized rules and procedures that govern how data is transmitted, received, and interpreted across computer networks. They define the format, timing, sequencing, and error control in data communication. Key protocols include:\nTCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): The fundamental suite for Internet communication.\nHTTP/HTTPS: For web browsing and secure data transfer on the web.\nFTP/SFTP: File transfer protocols.\nSMTP/POP3/IMAP: Email communication protocols.\nDNS: For domain name resolution.\nDHCP: For automatic IP address assignment.\nSSL/TLS: For secure, encrypted communication.\nUDP: For fast, connectionless data transmission.\narticle Cloudflare - What is SSL?\narticle Cloudflare - What is TLS?\narticle Everything you need to know about HTTP\narticle What is HTTP?\narticle What is HTTPS?\narticle What is DNS?\nvideo DNS and How does it Work?\nvideo DNS Records\nvideo SSH vs SSL vs TLS\nvideo OpenSSH Full Guide\n◇FTP/SFTP(File Transfer) FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network. It operates on a client-server model, typically using separate control and data connections between the client and server. FTP allows users to upload, download, and manage files on remote systems, supporting both authenticated and anonymous access. While widely used for its simplicity and compatibility, FTP has security limitations as it transmits data and credentials in plain text. As a result, more secure alternatives like SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) and FTPS (FTP Secure) have gained popularity for sensitive data transfers. Despite its age, FTP remains in use for various file transfer needs, especially in legacy systems and where security is less critical.\nSFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a secure file transfer protocol that provides file access, transfer, and management functionalities over a secure shell (SSH) data stream. It’s designed as an extension of SSH to offer secure file transfer capabilities. SFTP encrypts both commands and data in transit, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Unlike traditional FTP, SFTP uses a single connection and doesn’t separate control and data channels. It supports features like resuming interrupted transfers, directory listings, and remote file removal. SFTP is widely used in enterprise environments for secure file transfers, automated scripts, and as a more secure alternative to FTP. Its integration with SSH makes it a preferred choice for system administrators and developers working with remote systems securely.\narticle FTP vs SFTP vs FTPS article What is SFTP? ◇DNS(Domain Services) DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical, decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network. DNS serves as the internet’s phone book, enabling users to access websites using easy-to-remember names instead of numerical IP addresses. The system comprises DNS servers, resolvers, and records (like A, CNAME, MX), working together to route internet traffic efficiently. DNS is crucial for internet functionality, affecting everything from web browsing and email to load balancing and service discovery in modern cloud architectures.\narticle What is DNS? article How DNS Works (comic) video DNS and How does it Work? feed Explore top posts about DNS ◇HTTP(Web Communication) HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It’s an application-layer protocol that enables the transfer of various types of data, primarily web pages and their components, between clients (usually web browsers) and servers. HTTP operates on a request-response model, where clients send requests for resources, and servers respond with the requested data or error messages. It’s stateless by design, meaning each request is independent of previous ones. HTTP supports various methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for different types of operations. While originally designed for plain-text transmission, HTTPS, its secure version using encryption, is now widely adopted to protect data in transit.\narticle Everything you need to know about HTTP article What is HTTP? article An overview of HTTP video HTTP/1 to HTTP/2 to HTTP/3 video HTTP Crash Course \u0026 Exploration ◇HTTPS(Web Communication) HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, encrypting data exchanged between a client and a server. It uses SSL/TLS protocols to provide authentication, data integrity, and confidentiality. HTTPS prevents eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks by encrypting all communications. It uses digital certificates to verify the identity of websites, enhancing trust and security. HTTPS is crucial for protecting sensitive information like login credentials and financial data. It has become the standard for secure web communication, with major browsers marking non-HTTPS sites as “not secure.” HTTPS also provides SEO benefits and is essential for many modern web features and progressive web applications.\narticle What is HTTPS? article Why HTTPS Matters article Enabling HTTPS on Your Servers article How HTTPS works (comic) video Does HTTPS REALLY Keep You Safe? ◇SSL/TLS(Web Communication) Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are cryptographic protocols used to provide security in internet communications. These protocols encrypt the data that is transmitted over the web, so anyone who tries to intercept packets will not be able to interpret the data. One difference that is important to know is that SSL is now deprecated due to security flaws, and most modern web browsers no longer support it. But TLS is still secure and widely supported, so preferably use TLS.\narticle Cloudflare - What is SSL? article Cloudflare - What is TLS? article Wikipedia - SSL/TLS video SSH vs SSL vs TLS video SSL/TLS Explained in 7 Minutes ◇SSH(Web Communication) SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely access and manage remote machines over an unsecured network. It provides encrypted communication, ensuring confidentiality and integrity, and allows for secure file transfers, command execution, and tunneling. SSH is widely used for remote administration of servers, cloud infrastructure, and networking devices, typically employing key-based authentication or passwords. Tools like OpenSSH are commonly used to establish SSH connections, providing a secure alternative to older, less secure protocols like Telnet.\nofficial What is SSH? article SSH Intro article SFTP using SSH video How SSH Works feed Explore top posts about SSH ◇OSI Model The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. These layers, from bottom to top, are: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. Each layer serves a specific purpose in the process of data communication, with lower layers handling more hardware-oriented tasks and upper layers dealing with software and user-interface aspects. The model helps in understanding how data moves through a network, troubleshooting network issues, and designing network protocols and hardware. While not strictly adhered to in real-world implementations, the OSI model remains a valuable educational tool and reference point for network engineers and developers, providing a common language for discussing network operations and architecture.\narticle What is OSI Model? video OSI Model video OSI vs TCP/IP Model ◇White/Grey Listing(Email Protocols) Whitelisting involves creating a list of trusted entities (such as IP addresses, email addresses, or applications) that are explicitly allowed to access a system or send messages. Anything not on the whitelist is denied by default. Whitelisting offers a high level of security by limiting access to only known and approved entities, but it can be inflexible and require frequent updates to accommodate legitimate changes. Greylisting is a more flexible approach used primarily in email filtering. When an email is received from an unknown sender, the server temporarily rejects it with a “try again later” response. Legitimate mail servers will retry sending the email after a short delay, while spammers, which often do not retry, are blocked. This method reduces spam by taking advantage of the fact that spammers usually do not follow retry mechanisms. Greylisting can be less intrusive than whitelisting, but it may introduce slight delays in email delivery for first-time senders.\narticle Detailed Introduction to greylisting video Greylisting video How to Whitelist an Email Address? ◇SMTP(Email Protocols) Email is emerging as one of the most valuable services on the internet today. Most internet systems use SMTP as a method to transfer mail from one user to another. SMTP is a push protocol and is used to send the mail whereas POP (post office protocol) or IMAP (internet message access protocol) are used to retrieve those emails at the receiver’s side. SMTP is an application layer protocol. The client who wants to send the mail opens a TCP connection to the SMTP server and then sends the mail across the connection. The SMTP server is an always-on listening mode. As soon as it listens for a TCP connection from any client, the SMTP process initiates a connection through port 25. After successfully establishing a TCP connection the client process sends the mail instantly.\narticle What is SMTP? - Cloudflare article SMTP - Wikipedia video What is SMTP and how does it work? feed Explore top posts about Serverless ◇DMARC(Email Protocols) DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) is an email authentication protocol that builds upon SPF and DKIM to protect against email spoofing and phishing attacks. It allows domain owners to specify how email receivers should handle messages that fail authentication checks. DMARC provides a feedback mechanism for domain owners to receive reports on email authentication results, helping them monitor and improve their email security. By implementing DMARC policies, organizations can enhance their email deliverability, protect their brand reputation, and reduce the likelihood of their domain being used in fraudulent email campaigns. DMARC is widely adopted by major email providers and is considered a crucial component of modern email security strategies.\nofficial DMARC video What is DMARC: Email Security You Need to Know About feed Explore top posts about Security ◇IMAP(Email Protocols) IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a standard email protocol that allows email clients to access messages stored on a mail server. Unlike POP3, IMAP keeps emails on the server, enabling access from multiple devices while maintaining synchronization. It supports folder structures, message flagging, and partial message retrieval, making it efficient for managing large volumes of emails. IMAP allows users to search server-side, reducing bandwidth usage. It’s designed for long-term mail storage on the server, ideal for users who need to access their email from various devices or locations. IMAP’s synchronization capabilities and server-side management features make it the preferred protocol for most modern email systems, especially in mobile and multi-device environments.\narticle Wikipedia: Internet Message Access Protocol video What are POP3, IMAP, and SMTP? ◇SPF(Email Protocols) Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is used to authenticate the sender of an email. With an SPF record in place, Internet Service Providers can verify that a mail server is authorized to send email for a specific domain. An SPF record is a DNS TXT record containing a list of the IP addresses that are allowed to send email on behalf of your domain.\narticle What is a DNS SPF record? video What is SPF? Sender Policy Framework Explained ◇POP3S(Email Protocols) POP3 (port 110) or POP3s (port 995) stands for The Post Office Protocol. It’s an Internet standard protocol used by local email software clients to retrieve emails from a remote mail server over a TCP/IP connection. Email servers hosted by Internet service providers also use POP3 to receive and hold emails intended for their subscribers. Periodically, these subscribers will use email client software to check their mailbox on the remote server and download any emails addressed to them. Once the email client has downloaded the emails, they are usually deleted from the server, although some email clients allow users to specify that mails be copied or saved on the server for a period of time.\narticle What is POP3? video What are POP3, IMAP, and SMTP? ◇Domain Keys(Email Protocols) DomainKeys is an email authentication method designed to verify the domain of an email sender and ensure message integrity. Developed by Yahoo, it was a precursor to DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail). DomainKeys uses public key cryptography to allow email systems to verify that a message was sent by an authorized sender and hasn’t been tampered with in transit. The sending server signs outgoing emails with a private key, and receiving servers can verify the signature using a public key published in the sender’s DNS records. While largely superseded by DKIM, DomainKeys played a crucial role in the evolution of email authentication techniques aimed at combating email spoofing and phishing attacks.\narticle DomainKeys Identified Mail video What is DKIM?

It acts on behalf of clients, potentially providing benefits like anonymity, security, and access control. Forward proxies can cache frequently requested content, filter web traffic, bypass geographical restrictions, and log user activity. They’re commonly used in corporate networks to enforce internet usage policies, enhance security by hiding internal network details, and improve performance through caching. Unlike reverse proxies, which serve resources on behalf of servers, forward proxies primarily serve client-side needs, acting as an intermediary for outbound requests to the wider internet.</p>

<p>A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices and backend servers, intercepting requests from clients and forwarding them to appropriate backend servers. It acts on behalf of the servers, providing benefits such as load balancing, caching, SSL termination, and security. Reverse proxies can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability, cache frequently requested content to reduce server load, handle SSL encryption and decryption to offload this task from backend servers, and provide an additional layer of security by hiding server details. Common uses include improving web application performance, enabling microservices architectures, and enhancing security in web hosting environments. Popular reverse proxy software includes NGINX, HAProxy, and Apache with mod_proxy.</p>

<p>A caching server, also known as a proxy server or cache server, is a dedicated network server that saves web pages and other Internet content locally to reduce bandwidth usage, server load, and perceived lag. It works by intercepting requests from clients, saving the responses from web servers, and serving cached content to subsequent requests for the same information. Caching servers can significantly improve response times and reduce network traffic, especially for frequently accessed content. They are commonly used in content delivery networks (CDNs), enterprise networks, and Internet service providers to optimize performance, reduce costs, and enhance user experience by serving content from a location closer to the end-user.</p>

<p>FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network. It operates on a client-server model, typically using separate control and data connections between the client and server. FTP allows users to upload, download, and manage files on remote systems, supporting both authenticated and anonymous access. While widely used for its simplicity and compatibility, FTP has security limitations as it transmits data and credentials in plain text. As a result, more secure alternatives like SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) and FTPS (FTP Secure) have gained popularity for sensitive data transfers. Despite its age, FTP remains in use for various file transfer needs, especially in legacy systems and where security is less critical.</p>
<p>SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a secure file transfer protocol that provides file access, transfer, and management functionalities over a secure shell (SSH) data stream. It’s designed as an extension of SSH to offer secure file transfer capabilities. SFTP encrypts both commands and data in transit, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Unlike traditional FTP, SFTP uses a single connection and doesn’t separate control and data channels. It supports features like resuming interrupted transfers, directory listings, and remote file removal. SFTP is widely used in enterprise environments for secure file transfers, automated scripts, and as a more secure alternative to FTP. Its integration with SSH makes it a preferred choice for system administrators and developers working with remote systems securely.</p>

<p>DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical, decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It translates human-readable domain names (like <a href="https://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network. DNS serves as the internet’s phone book, enabling users to access websites using easy-to-remember names instead of numerical IP addresses. The system comprises DNS servers, resolvers, and records (like A, CNAME, MX), working together to route internet traffic efficiently. DNS is crucial for internet functionality, affecting everything from web browsing and email to load balancing and service discovery in modern cloud architectures.</p>

<p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It’s an application-layer protocol that enables the transfer of various types of data, primarily web pages and their components, between clients (usually web browsers) and servers. HTTP operates on a request-response model, where clients send requests for resources, and servers respond with the requested data or error messages. It’s stateless by design, meaning each request is independent of previous ones. HTTP supports various methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for different types of operations. While originally designed for plain-text transmission, HTTPS, its secure version using encryption, is now widely adopted to protect data in transit.</p>

<h3 id="whitegrey-listingemail-protocols">◇White/Grey Listing(<em>Email Protocols</em>)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#whitegrey-listingemail-protocols">#</a></h3>
<p>Whitelisting involves creating a list of trusted entities (such as IP addresses, email addresses, or applications) that are explicitly allowed to access a system or send messages. Anything not on the whitelist is denied by default. Whitelisting offers a high level of security by limiting access to only known and approved entities, but it can be inflexible and require frequent updates to accommodate legitimate changes. Greylisting is a more flexible approach used primarily in email filtering. When an email is received from an unknown sender, the server temporarily rejects it with a “try again later” response. Legitimate mail servers will retry sending the email after a short delay, while spammers, which often do not retry, are blocked. This method reduces spam by taking advantage of the fact that spammers usually do not follow retry mechanisms. Greylisting can be less intrusive than whitelisting, but it may introduce slight delays in email delivery for first-time senders.</p>

<p>Email is emerging as one of the most valuable services on the internet today. Most internet systems use SMTP as a method to transfer mail from one user to another. SMTP is a push protocol and is used to send the mail whereas POP (post office protocol) or IMAP (internet message access protocol) are used to retrieve those emails at the receiver’s side. SMTP is an application layer protocol. The client who wants to send the mail opens a TCP connection to the SMTP server and then sends the mail across the connection. The SMTP server is an always-on listening mode. As soon as it listens for a TCP connection from any client, the SMTP process initiates a connection through port 25. After successfully establishing a TCP connection the client process sends the mail instantly.</p>

<p>Kubernetes is an open source container management platform, and the dominant product in this space. Using Kubernetes, teams can deploy images across multiple underlying hosts, defining their desired availability, deployment logic, and scaling logic in YAML. Kubernetes evolved from Borg, an internal Google platform used to provision and allocate compute resources (similar to the Autopilot and Aquaman systems of Microsoft Azure). The popularity of Kubernetes has made it an increasingly important skill for the DevOps Engineer and has triggered the creation of Platform teams across the industry. These Platform engineering teams often exist with the sole purpose of making Kubernetes approachable and usable for their product development colleagues.</p>

<h2 id="20-gitops">20. GitOps<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#20-gitops">#</a></h2>
<p>GitOps is a paradigm for managing infrastructure and application deployments using Git as the single source of truth. It extends DevOps practices by using Git repositories to store declarative descriptions of infrastructure and applications. Changes to the desired state are made through pull requests, which trigger automated processes to align the actual state with the desired state. GitOps relies on continuous deployment tools that automatically reconcile the live system with the desired state defined in Git. This approach provides benefits such as version control for infrastructure, improved auditability, easier rollbacks, and enhanced collaboration. GitOps is particularly well-suited for cloud-native applications and Kubernetes environments, offering a streamlined method for managing complex, distributed systems.</p>
